  For my visual programming class, we had to develop an application that implements a REST API. I decided to make an encyclopedia containing all the info for the popular FPS game made by RIOT games "Valorant". 
  
Features: 
1.) This app used the unofficial Valorant API. 
2.) Multi Page app broken down by each of the games main elements...
    a.) Characters - Breaks down each unique characters abilities and roles
    b.) Guns - Breaks down weapons by their class and provides insights to their stats.
    c.) Maps - Includes load view and in game view
    d.) Team Builder - A self integrated feature.
3.) Provided each page in a sleek and easy to read/presentable way. 
4.) UI is easy to navigate and conistent throughout the app. 
5.) Team Builder is self implemented feature allowing the user to build a team of characters, name the team, and save locally to machine. 
6.) Implements threading to allow many elements to be loaded simultaneously.
